# BEPEC-Machine-learning-project

MLproject-1

**Project Overview**

•	Objective: Develop a classification model to predict whether candidates will be hired based on various attributes.

•	Dataset: Consists of 690 candidates with 16 features, including both categorical and numerical variables. The target variable is the "Hired" flag (0 or 1).


**Tools Used**

•	Programming Language: Python

•	Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

•	Data Preprocessing Techniques: Label Encoding, Handling Missing Values, Outlier Detection

•	Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier

•	Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC



**Responsibilities**

•	Loaded the dataset using Pandas. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables 
    and detect any inconsistencies or missing values.
    
•	Replaced missing values and anomalies in the dataset.

•	Used label encoding for categorical features to convert them into numerical format.

•	Conducted outlier detection and removal to improve model performance.

•	Separated numerical and categorical features for more targeted preprocessing.

•	Scaled numerical features to ensure they contribute equally to model training.

•	Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

•	Trained classification models using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

•	Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC scores to determine the best-performing model.

•	Created visualizations to illustrate data distributions and model performance.

•	Prepared a report summarizing the methodology, results, and insights from the analysis.
